# Drag'n Share
*Drag'n Share* is a very easy to use application with which you can share files
and directories across computers in a local network. This works on Windows, Mac
OSX and Linux and requires no internet or credentials what so ever.

## Usage
When *Drag'n Share* is launched it will show it self in the system tray (the
icons near clock). Clicking on the tray icon will show the *DropZone*.

To share a file you open the the *DropZone* and drap a file or directory in the
window. Other users in your network will see the dropped file and can drag is
back out the window.
